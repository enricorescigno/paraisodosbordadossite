# MySQL Database Integration - Status: ACTIVATED

This directory contains service files for database integration with MySQL. The integration is now **ACTIVE** and ready to use.

## SECURITY NOTICE

**CRITICAL**: All API services in this directory have been updated to use environment variables for credentials. The following environment variables must be set for production:

- `VITE_API_USERNAME`: API username for external services
- `VITE_API_PASSWORD`: API password for external services

**DO NOT** commit actual credentials to version control.

## Current Status

- MySQL connection logic is implemented and activated
- API endpoints will attempt to use the database connection first
- If database connection fails or returns no data, the system will fall back to mock data

## Security Improvements Implemented

### 1. Credential Management
- Removed hardcoded credentials from all service files
- Implemented environment variable-based authentication
- Added credential validation before API calls

### 2. Network Security
- Changed all HTTP endpoints to HTTPS where possible
- Added request timeouts (10-15 seconds) to prevent hanging requests
- Implemented proper error handling without information disclosure

### 3. Input Validation
- Added input sanitization for all user inputs
- Implemented parameter validation for API calls
- Added proper encoding for URL parameters

### 4. Error Handling
- Standardized error responses
- Removed sensitive information from error messages
- Added proper timeout handling

## Configuration

The database connection should be configured with the following credentials in environment variables:

```
VITE_API_USERNAME=your_username
VITE_API_PASSWORD=your_password
```

## Security Notes

- Never commit database credentials to version control
- Use environment variables for all sensitive information
- Consider using a connection pool for production environments
- Implement proper error handling and connection management
- All external API calls now use HTTPS
- Request timeouts are implemented to prevent DoS
- Input validation is applied to all user inputs

## Activated Functions

- `getConnection()`: Establishes a MySQL connection and returns the connection object
- `getConnectionPool()`: Creates a MySQL connection pool for handling multiple concurrent requests
- `getProducts()`: Fetches the list of products from the database
- `getPortfolioItems()`: Fetches portfolio items from the database

## API Integration

The following API handlers now use secure practices:
- All services validate credentials before making requests
- HTTPS is used for all external communications
- Proper input validation and sanitization
- Request timeouts to prevent hanging connections
- Standardized error handling

## Additional Security Tools

A new security utilities file (`src/utils/securityUtils.ts`) has been created with:
- Input sanitization helpers
- Email validation
- Rate limiting utilities
- Secure token generation
- Content Security Policy helpers

**Note:** To use the actual database, set the environment variables with real credentials.
