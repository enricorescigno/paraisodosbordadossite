# Database Integration - Status: PREPARED BUT NOT ACTIVATED

This directory contains service files for database integration with MySQL. The integration is currently **NOT ACTIVE** and is only prepared for future implementation.

## Current Status

- MySQL connection logic is implemented but not activated
- No active database connections are being made
- All API endpoints return mock data or empty arrays

## Activation Instructions

To activate the MySQL integration in the future:

1. Replace placeholder credentials with actual database credentials using environment variables
2. Uncomment the connection code in the service functions
3. Update API handlers to use the real database connection
4. Test thoroughly before deploying to production

## Security Notes

- Never commit database credentials to version control
- Use environment variables for all sensitive information
- Consider using a connection pool for production environments
- Implement proper error handling and connection management

## Files

- `mysqlService.ts`: Core database connection and query functions
- `../api/*.ts`: API endpoint handlers that will use the database service

---

**IMPORTANT:** Do not activate any database connections until explicitly instructed to do so.
